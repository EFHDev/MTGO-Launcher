## Features

### Steam-Like Subscription Based Downloading and Installing
MTGO Launcher offers a subscription-based model similar to Steam, allowing users to access and download mods seamlessly. This feature streamlines the process of acquiring and installing mods, making it more convenient and user-friendly.


### Multiple Mod Profiles with Separate User-Profiles
MTGO Launcher introduces the concept of multiple mod profiles, allowing users to create and manage different sets of mods for their games. Each mod profile can have its own separate user-profiles, enabling users to customize their experience for different gameplay styles or preferences.

### Auto Updates for Mods
Stay up-to-date effortlessly with the auto update feature of MTGO Launcher. When a new version of a mod is released, the launcher will automatically download and install the latest version, ensuring that you always have the most current enhancements and fixes.

### Seamless Management of Mods for MTGA
MTGO Launcher simplifies the management of mods by providing the ability to handle mods for Make Tarkov Great Again. This compatibility allows users to organize and customize their mods for each profile independently. Additionally, the launcher enables users to switch between these profiles in one click eliminating the hassle of navigating through multiple interfaces.
